*** helpers for RSWGame, Star Web, and Starcon

* magic.rb: the most useful of the bunch, but needs tons of customization per user, per game

* adept.rb: an aborted attempt at running the tool via Camping

* rxTurn.rb, readTurn.rb: test reading the xml file via REXML.

* SCORPION\_T3.xml: test file for Starcon

* scotomat.txt: test file for RSWGame (Starweb compatibility mode)
